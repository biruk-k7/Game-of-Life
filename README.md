## About The Project
This Java-based project offers a visual representation of John Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton renowned for its ability to generate intricate patterns from simple rules. Users can initialize the size of the grid with various patterns, including gliders, blinker, and beacon, and then observe the simulation unfold as the cells evolve based on their neighbors' states. The project provides a captivating and educational experience, allowing users to explore the fascinating world of cellular automata

To compile and run the program, in the terminal, type:

javac *.java

java gameOfLife
